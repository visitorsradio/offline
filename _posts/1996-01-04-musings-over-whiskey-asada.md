# Musings Over Whiskey Asada

off the new sensation,  
tired and weak  
always trying something different  
but i never find relief  

sirens in the distance  
second time this week  
take a twenty from the dresser  
and let's all go out to eat  

we all,  
take our time  
we all,  
say our lines  


now, i believe in patience  
it's difficult for me  
i'm a smooth operator  
with a demon up my sleeve  

staring through the looking glass  
liking what you see  
he's got the million dollar smile  
with the ten cent teeth  

we all,  
take our time  
we all,  
say our lines
