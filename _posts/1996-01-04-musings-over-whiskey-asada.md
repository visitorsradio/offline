Don't give way to superstition  
Planet Earth is on a mission  
If you stare into the light  
You'll lose your eyes but not your vision  

I could be the Lord's antenna  
I could be a perfect ten  
But I won't be the man you want  
If I can't get my shit together  

All the birds and bees are falling over  
Under chestnut trees we're falling over  
Hearts at Wounded Knee are falling over  
The Aegean Sea is falling over  

Local 413 is falling over  
Taller men than me are falling over  
Broken and unclean we're falling over  
Everything I see is falling over
