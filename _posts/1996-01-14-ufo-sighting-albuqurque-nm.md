Hey folks,

I'm back from my 2 week journey through the Mojave, and it was fruitful.

First, let me catch you up, after the town hall drama that ensued last month.

I am OK. Mentally. Physically. Spiritually. These snakes will never get the last swing, and I promise you, our fight will only end with the Believers on top. I'll fill you all in with more details at the next conference in April.

Now, I'm sure you're all wondering. Yes, I saw the same UFO pattern that I've been spouting on about for a year now. It had the same geometric light sequence, and was at the exact coordinates that I predicted from the last siting.

It all bread crumbs to the peak of the Mojave as I first theorized. Assuming it follows the same pattern as it has, which at this point it seems there is no reason that it shouldn't, the next siting should be there on March 3rd, 2026.

Don't forget your poles, when watching the skies,

Visitors Offline.
