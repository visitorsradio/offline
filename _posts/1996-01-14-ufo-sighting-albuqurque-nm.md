I'm back from my 2 week journey through New Mexico and Utah, and it was fruitful. New Mexicoo was a wash, as expected, but that piece of the trip was to prove that this pattern is indeed isolated to the Mojave Desert.

First, let me catch you up, after the town hall drama that ensued right before my trip.

I am OK. Mentally. Physically. Spiritually. 

These snakes will never get the last swing. I promise you: our fight will only end with the Believers on top. I'll fill you all in on the stuff you really want to hear at the conference in April.

Now, I'm sure you're all wondering. Yes, I saw the same UFO pattern that I've been spouting on about for a year now. 

It had the same geometric light sequence, and was at the exact coordinates that I predicted from the last siting.

The chart spiral fractal bread crumbs straight to the peak of the Mojave as I first theorized. Assuming it follows the same pattern as it has in the past, which at this point, it seems that there is no reason it shouldn't, the next siting should be at the coordinates that I emailed to you all in Clark Mountain, CA. The time for the next Visit is 01:09, March 3rd.
